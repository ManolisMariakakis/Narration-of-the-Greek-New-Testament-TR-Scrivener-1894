## Textus Receptus (Scrivener 1894)

Scrivener's Textus Receptus is, in essence, an edited version of Beza's Textus Receptus, adjusted to align with the readings adopted by the Authorized King James Version. This edition should not be confused with Scrivener's printings of Stephanus' Textus Receptus.

Textus Receptus (Latin for "received text") refers to a series of significant Byzantine Greek manuscripts and printed texts of the New Testament, produced between 1500 and 1900. These include Erasmus' *Novum Instrumentum omne* (1516), Stephanus' editions (1550), Beza's edition (1598), the Elzevir house editions (1633), and Scrivener's edition (1894).
